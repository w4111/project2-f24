## Teammate Policy

Projects are to be done in teams, and we have not prohibited students from seeking new team members.

1. Please be respectful of your teammates if you choose to switch teams, and do not switch if it is within a week of the deadline.
2. If you have lost a teammate (because they found a new teammate or have dropped the class) and cannot find a new teammate, it is OK to complete the project on your own.
3. If you and your partner simply wish to work individually on the project, that is not a valid reason to work individually.
